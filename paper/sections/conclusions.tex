\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

At the risk of promoting a new testing paradigm, perhaps 
called Development Driven Testing (DDT), the author 
presented a non-generative-AI approach to 
programmatically generating Python unit tests through
the execution of a single developer (or even AI)-crafted
functional test.

As partly noted above, future work should include: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reduced reliance on \textit{eval}
  \item File and socket I/O
  \item Complete OOP support
  \item Multi-thread and multi-process testing and support
  \item Applicability in other languages with strong metaprogramming support such as C\#, Go, and Zig
\end{enumerate}

The code is available in a single Python file to permit 
easy integration into any supported Python project.
The author wishes to give back to the computing community
and therfore offers this project free and open source
in the hopes that it will be found useful and lay the ground
work for future related research and application.
The author hopes the concepts described herein will be 
applied in other languages with strong metaprogramming support
such as C\#, Go, Zig, etc.  Further information on the code and  documentation, please
